## Simple desktop web test

* Open Visual Studio
* Build solution
* Run test called `EdgeW3C` in `Core.Selenium.Examples` project
* Head to [saucelabs.com](https://accounts.saucelabs.com/am/XUI/#login/) to look at the running test

🎖Success is when the test runs

## Cross-browser testing

⭐️ Cross-browser functional bugs rarely exist in today's web technology and doing cross-browser functional testing on an entire test suite is inneficient

⭐️ It's more common to find cross-browser rendering issues, especially for responsive web apps. This problem is solved with [visual testing](https://saucelabs.com/platform/visual-testing)

* Go to 
* Add `[TestFixtureSource(typeof(TestConfigData), nameof(TestConfigData.PopularDesktopCombinations))]` to the top of the class
* Run the tests and notice how fast the parallel build is
* Check out the [Insights Tab](https://app.saucelabs.com/analytics/test-overview)

🎖Success is when all the tests run

## Emusim web testing

* Navigate to `Emusim.Web.Start.AndroidEmusimTests`
* Try to run the android tests using command line

```bash
cd demo-csharp\DotnetCore\Sauce.Demo
dotnet test .\Core.Selenium.Examples --filter TestCategory=android-end
```

🎖The tests should pass

👁Let's take a look at what's going on in this test?

### Your challenge (should you choose to accept it) is to create a similar test but to run on iOS

* ⏰ 10 min
* Go to this class `Core.Selenium.Examples.Emusim.Web.Start.IOSEmusimTests.cs`
* Find all the `//TODO` and implement them
* Run the test

🎖The tests should pass
